# Project Documentation

## Project Idea

The project aims to create a copyright protection system for digital content (photos, videos, and audio) shared on a platform. The system will provide content owners with tools to protect their personal content, ensure its privacy, and detect unauthorized sharing. Key features include encryption, watermarking, content analysis, reporting, and moderation.

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements

1. User Authentication and Authorization
   - Users must register and authenticate to access the platform.
   - Different user roles (content owners, regular users) with varying privileges.

2. Content Upload and Storage
   - Users can upload personal photos, videos, and audio files.
   - Content is securely stored with encryption at rest.

3. Content Encryption
   - Personal content (photos, videos, audio) is encrypted using AES encryption.
   - Authorized users can decrypt content for viewing or download.

4. Watermarking
   - Personal content can be watermarked with copyright information.
   - Watermarking can be visible or invisible, depending on user preference.

5. Content Analysis
   - Implement image and audio analysis for identifying personal content.
   - Detection of personal content during uploads and downloads.

6. Reporting and Moderation
   - Users can report content that violates platform policies.
   - Content moderation to review reported content and take action.

7. Image Hashing
   - Generate image hashes for duplicate detection.
   - Detect identical copies of images based on hash values.

8. Secure Storage
   - Ensure personal content is stored securely.
   - Encryption keys are managed securely.

### Non-Functional Requirements

1. Security and Privacy
   - Protection of personal content through encryption.
   - Robust detection of unauthorized sharing.
   - Compliance with copyright and privacy laws.

2. Performance
   - Efficient handling of content uploads and downloads.
   - Fast image hashing and content analysis.

3. Usability
   - User-friendly interface for content management.
   - Clear copyright and privacy policies.

4. Scalability
   - Ability to handle a growing user base and content library.

## Frameworks and Technologies

- Backend Framework: Django (Python)
- Frontend Framework: [Your choice]
- Database: [Your choice]
- Encryption: AES (Advanced Encryption Standard)
- Content Analysis: [Specify the image and audio analysis libraries or tools]

## Encryption Algorithms

- AES (Advanced Encryption Standard) for encrypting photos, videos, and audio.
- Use of AES-CTR or AES-GCM modes for secure encryption and decryption.
- Encryption keys stored securely and accessible only to authorized users.

## Content Analysis

- Content analysis involves using image and audio analysis libraries or tools to identify personal content.
- Image analysis detects personal photos based on visual cues and unique features.
- Audio analysis detects personal audio based on characteristics such as voice recognition.
- Analysis is performed during content uploads and downloads to detect unauthorized sharing.

## Reporting and Moderation

- Users can report content that violates platform policies or infringes on copyrights.
- Reported content is reviewed by content moderators.
- Action is taken to address violations, including content removal and user warnings.

## Image Hashing

- Image hashing techniques are employed for duplicate detection.
- Hash values are generated for images and used to compare uploaded content with existing content.
- Identical copies of images are detected based on hash matches.

## Secure Storage

- Personal content is stored in a secure manner, with encryption at rest.
- Strong access controls to prevent unauthorized access to content.
- Regular security audits and updates to ensure data security.
