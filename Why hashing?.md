# Some Notes

## Why we Prefer Perceptual hashing over invisible watermarking?

### Watermarking
- **Considerations :**

  1. **Visibility:** Some users may find visible watermarks obtrusive or detracting from the content's aesthetics.
  2. **Quality Impact:** Watermarking can introduce some quality degradation, especially if not applied carefully.
  3. **Removal Attempts:** While watermarks are challenging to remove, determined individuals with the right skills can still attempt to do so.

### Perceptual Hashing

- **Advantages:**

  1. **Content Recognition:** Perceptual hashing focuses on capturing visual or perceptual similarity between images. It is useful for detecting near-duplicate content.
  2. **Efficiency:** Perceptual hashing is often computationally efficient and can quickly identify similar images.
  3. **Discreetness:** Perceptual hashes are not visible to users, so they do not alter the content's appearance.
